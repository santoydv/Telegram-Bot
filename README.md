# Telegram-Bot

This project involves creating a Telegram bot in Python that extracts movie details from IMDb using the OMDB API. The bot allows users to enter movie titles and receive instant information such as ratings, release dates, and cast details directly within their Telegram chats. It also supports exporting fetched data in CSV format via Telegram, integrating web scraping techniques learned from various online resources.
